          I am currently working full-time as an iOS Developer at
          <a
            target="_blank"
            href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/squadpod/id1417245833"
            >SquadPod</a
          >
          (3+ years). Before working on SquadPod, I worked as a Freelance iOS
          Developer for 2 years. I built 7 different apps for small businesses
          and clients.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2020, I launched a stock market app called
          <a

            href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stock-sim-paper-trading/id1543305106?platform=iphone"
            >Stock Sim: Paper Trading</a
          >. It's an app that allows users to paper trade stocks in real time. I
          built it in UIKit and Swift with new features in SwiftUI. It also has
          a monetization system with ads from Google Admob, In-App Purchases,
          and Subscriptions powered by

          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          I graduated from

          >
          with a <b>Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science</b> in 2020 during the
          COVID-19 pandemic. I've been working in the tech industry for 4 years
          now.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of my passions is teaching people how to code on
